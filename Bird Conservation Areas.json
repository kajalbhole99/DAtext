In 2006, within the BCA, there were 35 pairs of least terns on Hicks Island, 17 pairs at Goff Point and 3 pairs at Napeague Beach (2006, Coy) although they were unsuccessful (see below). Diversity of birds is due in part to the fact that Napeague/Hither Hills is part of one of the largest, relatively unfragmented areas of maritime open space on eastern Long Island. Diversity of breeding birds is high including beach/dune species such as piping plover, least terns and American oystercatchers. Roseate terns and black skimmers have bred here in the past.\n\nSpecies at risk include both breeding and wintering species. The area around Napeague Harbor is one of the few sites on eastern Long Island that is still occupied by northern harriers during the breeding season. In addition to breeding by state threatened species, northern harrier and least terns, and species of special concern, osprey, the site also hosts state endangered wintering short-eared owls. The state-endangered/federally threatened piping plover nests at Hicks Island, Goff Point and Napeague Beach. In 2006, 23 pairs fledged 11 young. In 2005, 18 pairs fledged 23 young. The Hicks Island common tern colony was one of the more successful sites for common terns on Long Island (Evans, et. al. 2000).

All of the forest, grassland and shrub/scrub species for which we have high regional responsibility are found here including breeding sharp-shinned hawk, black-billed cuckoo, eastern wood-pewee, wood thrush, cerulean warbler, rose-breasted grosbeak, Baltimore oriole, killdeer, bobolink, eastern meadowlark, American woodcock, willow flycatcher, brown thrasher, blue-winged warbler, golden-winged warbler, eastern towhee and field sparrow. More than 30 species of warblers have been recorded in the park with 25 confirmed breeders. There are an estimated 534 pairs of hooded warblers and 110 pairs of mourning warblers. This is one of the few sites in upstate New York with breeding yellow-breasted chats. Winter roosts of 15-20 turkey vultures have been confirmed. As many as 200 turkey vultures may be observed on a single day in the summer. State listed birds confirmed as breeders in the park include Threatened bald eagle and Special Concern sharp-shinned hawk, Cooper's hawk, northern goshawk, red-shouldered hawk, red-headed woodpecker, golden-winged warbler, cerulean warbler, vesper sparrow and grasshopper sparrow. Species that exceeded the IBA species at risk threshold are American woodcock, willow flycatcher, wood thrush, blue-winged warbler, cerulean warbler, Canada warbler, yellow-breasted chat and rusty blackbird.",
